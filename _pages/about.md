<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. I focus on studying and improving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Foundation Models (GFM). My recent research interest is in the intersection of Graph Models and Large Language Models, from GFM to graph-based retrieval augmented generation.

*Very recent interests on developing universal graph foundation model! Our work accepted as ICLR-24 Spotlight is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00149). I am excited to talk about related ideas.*

I obtained my Bachelor's degree also from Washington University in St. Louis. It is my honor to be advised by Dr. Yixin Chen towards my Ph.D. degree. For details, check out my [CV](https://github.com/LechengKong/LechengKong.github.io/blob/main/docs/resume.pdf).


<h2>I am actively looking for Full-time position starting Summer/Fall 2025. If you are interested in my work, I would love to chat and discuss potential opportunities.</h2>

# 🔥 News
- *2024.08*: &nbsp;🔥🔥 [GOFA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09709) released, we propose a generative approach to solve a wide variety of tasks in the graph domain. GOFA can generate free-form graph-related response to arbitrary human input.
- *2024.08*: &nbsp;🔥🔥 [TAGLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14683) released, TAGLAS aim to provide a graph dataset with high diversity from synthetic to real-world data. Check it out if you are building graph foundation models.
- *2024.01*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 [COLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10376) accpeted by WWW2024! Congratulations to Hao!
- *2024.01*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 [OneForAll](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00149) paper accepted as Spotlight (5%) by ICLR2024. Thanks everyone for the great teamwork!
- *2023.09*: Check out our newest work combining Graph Neural Networks with LLMs! ([Code](https://github.com/LechengKong/OneForAll), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00149)) Using LLM, we design a GNN that is cross-domain (citation network, molecular graph, etc) and cross-task (node-level, link-level, zero-shot, etc), potentially serving as a pathway to graph foundation model.
- *2023.09*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Two paper, [MAG-GNN](https://openreview.net/forum?id=K4FK7I8Jnl) and [(k,t)-FWL](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UlJcZoawgU) accepted by Neurips 23!
