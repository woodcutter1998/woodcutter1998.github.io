<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis. I focus on studying and improving Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Foundation Models (GFM). My recent research interest is in the intersection of Graph Models and Large Language Models, from GFM to graph-based retrieval augmented generation.

*Very recent interests on developing universal graph foundation model! Our work accepted as ICLR-24 Spotlight is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00149). I am excited to talk about related ideas.*

I obtained my Bachelor's degree also from Washington University in St. Louis. It is my honor to be advised by Dr. Yixin Chen towards my Ph.D. degree. For details, check out my [CV](https://github.com/LechengKong/LechengKong.github.io/blob/main/docs/resume.pdf).


<h2>I am actively looking for Full-time research-oriented position starting Summer/Fall 2025. If you are interested in my work, I would love to chat and discuss potential opportunities. You can contact me through email.</h2>
